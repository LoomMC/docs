# What is Loom?

Loom is a mod framework similar to Forge/Fabric for the Java Edition. Loom strives to be a fast framework, as we are built with a C/C++ backend, which not only makes your mod compatible with the game, but lets it, run smoothly when the game gets it. Loom also is built with a C++ based frontend API run with a DLL for the best user-functionality.
